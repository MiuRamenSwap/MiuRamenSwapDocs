# How to Get Fantom

### Bridging to Fantom

You can bridge tokens from Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon or Avalanche to Fantom on the [SpookySwap bridge](https://spookyswap.finance/bridge).

If you have FTMs on a network other than Fantom Opera, you can use SpookySwap's Bridge feature to move them to Fantom Opera Nework.

For example, if you have an FTM on Binance Smart Chain, you can withdraw directly to the Fantom chain. Note that FTM gas is also required on Fantom Opera.

After bridging to Fantom Opera with SpookySwap or multichain, you can receive gas in FTM. You can also refer to the SpookySwap manual for more information on Bridge.

&#x20;see [SpookySwap guide page](https://docs.spookyswap.finance/products/bridge)

### How to Get Free Fantom Gas

In order to use the bridge function, FTM gas is required for the transaction to take place. To solve this "chicken first or egg first" problem, FTM gas is provided free of charge. Thank you to the organization for providing it for free!\
