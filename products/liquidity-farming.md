# Liquidity Farming

The Liquidity farm is the place to stake your spLP (Spooky Liquidity Pair tokens) to earn MIUXs. These farms provide incentives to people providing liquidity to SpookySwap and help offset Impermanent Loss risk.

We are planning to support the following farms at launch, but this could change based on community preference/governance:

Have these tokens on another chain? You can bridge these tokens via [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/bridge) by following this guide. You can bridge your stable coins from ETH to FTM for free:

If you have provided liquidity to a Liquidity Pool that is available for rewards (if not, please see Farms at launch section), then now is the time to earn some MIUX! It is really easy to do.

1. First find the pair you wish to farm, and make the spLP for that pair on the Liquidity Page. We'll be farming MIUX-FTM, earning MIUX in this example
2. If this is your first time staking in this pool on SpookySwap, you will need an approval from your wallet to begin the process. Click on "**Approve**". This will prompt a transaction to approve our smart contracts handling your spLP tokens for that specific pool.
3. Once that is done, click on the "**Stake**" button
4. You will be shown a modal where you can specify how many of your spLP tokens you wish to stake
5. Once you've decided, clicking "**Confirm**" will then prompt you with the transaction necessary to stake the tokens in our smart contracts. After that.. all you have to do is relax, and wait for the MIUX to roll in! You can view your farm status in your Portfolio.
